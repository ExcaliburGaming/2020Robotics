Smart Servo: 0 is minimum, 1 is max. The parameters can be set however, but 0 will always be min, 1 will always be max.
I chose the max to be 90 degrees, because the servo will only need to go 90 degrees.

/*I plan to use a rack and pinion system to move the wobble goal over the wall.
I need to know the number of ticks for the wall and the pinion gear, so I can figure out how much I need the pinion gear to travel.
*/
/*
This is the circumference of the pinion gear: 2.597244094488189.
Divide the the number of ticks in one rotation by circumference of the wheel. This is the number of ticks in one inch.
(1120/2.597244094488189=431.2263149916629)
The number of ticks in an inch is 431.
I can use this formula to find the number of ticks in the wall that I need to travel.
The wall is 12 inches.
The wall is the number of ticks in an inch multiplied by the inches I need to travel.
(431x12=5172)
The wall is 5172 ticks.
Since the wobble goal is 12.5 inches, I'll need to move the wobble goal up at least 5,387.5 ticks.
I will add another inch in order to give the wobble goal some clearance when it is lifted.
It will take 5,818.5 ticks in order to raise the wobble goal an inch over the field wall.
